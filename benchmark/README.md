```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch Locust

```
locust -f locustfile.py
```


Then open http://localhost:8089

## Creating Benchmarks

`locustfile.py` supports 2 users classes - Publisher and Subscriber. Publisher is based on Locust's HTTPUser and Subscriber is based on Websockets. User distribution is 80-20 (20 Publishers, 80 Subscribers) and 10 topics.

Configure the total user count, the host (URL where FluxBalancer can be reached) and duration of the stress test.

Cluster Pub/Sub Relay has Horizontal Pod Autoscaling enabled, feel free to change the minimum and maximum container counts, to stress load with auto-scaling in action.
